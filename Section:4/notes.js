What is an algorithm?
-A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task.

Problem Solving:1 Understand the Problem
//

-Can I restate the problem in my own words?
-What are the inputs that go into the problem?
-What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
-Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough info to solve the problem?
-How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?



//

Problem Solving:2 Concrete Examples
//

-Coming up with examples can hekp you understand the problem better
-Examples also provide sanity checks that your eventual solution works how it should

-Start with simple examples
-Progress to more complex examples
-Explore examples with empty inputs
-Explore examples with invalid inputs

//

Problem Solving:3 Break it down
//

Explicitly write out the steps you need to take.
This forces you think about the code you'll write before you write it, and it helps you catch any lingering conceptual issues or misunderstandings before you dive in and have to worry about details (e.g. language syntax) as well.

//

Problem Solving:4 Solve or Simplifiy
//

-Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do.
-Temporarily ignore that difficulty.
-Write a simplified solution
-Then incorporate that difficulty back in
